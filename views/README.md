Bi Tam bio -- Business development -"Tam is a problem solver, through and through. His experience as an officer in the U.S. Army and engineer in the Energy sector are a testament to this. As a fellow classmate of Sonny at West Point, Tam leads Ronin Dev’s business development efforts and focuses on one of the most important problems companies face – growth. Call him a nerd if you want, but hen  currently spends his free time in school, earning his MBA at UCLA."
