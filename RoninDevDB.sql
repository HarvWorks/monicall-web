I see the excitement in the young entrepreneurs eyes as they continue to the vision of their own on-demand photo-sharing that will have a billion dollar exit. [&hellip;]</p>','<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-437\" src=\"/img/blog/0/header.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"864\" />\n                  “I have an app idea…”</p>\n                  <p>A phrase I hear often around Silicon Valley. I see the excitement in the young entrepreneurs eyes as they continue to the vision of their own on-demand photo-sharing that will have a billion dollar exit. </p>\n                  <p>It briefs well. Sounds easy. But the truth is, there’s a countless number of tasks that have to be executed well in order to reach even a seed round. The most vital of which starts with  building the app.</p>\n                  <p>Great apps are derived from the  synergic relationship between designers and developers. Here are the steps taken to make this happen.</p>\n                  <h4>1/ Create a wireframe</h4>\n                  <p>Imagine you had the chance to build your dream house. You know what you want. The circular driveway, Olympic sized swimming pool, Spanish tiles throughout, etc. All those details in your head will need to be communicated to your construction team so that they can get to work. This is done with a blueprint. Wireframes are just like blueprints in that they communicate all the details of your app idea to developers. <p>\n                  <p>You want your app to resonate with users on an emotional level. The wireframe is also the first step to achieve that. Simply, a wireframe is a detailed blueprint of your entire application. You want to design a intuitive way for your users to experience the value of your app. <p>\n                  <p>Although this sounds intuitive, many products die because they are unable to achieve this. Get started by defining a focused value proposition for your app. Once you have that, design every screen and interaction of your application. <p>\n                  <p>A perfect example is Snapchat. They define themselves as a camera company and reflect it in the product by allowing the user to access the camera as soon as they open the application. Define what value you want users to get out of your application and design around that. <p>\n                  <h4>2/ Getting feedback on the wireframe</h4>\n                  <p>Once you have a completed wireframe in your hands it’s time to put it in front of users. It can be humbling to receive feedback, but honest feedback is the best kind needed for growth. Products fail because they never achieve product-market fit. </p>\n                  <p>Have a whiteboard session with your team. Who would use your product? Ideally this would be the first thing you do before thinking about the product you’re creating, but revisit the initial hypotheses. College students as a segment is broad; what activities do they do, what itch does your product scratch for them? Define these and see how it resonates among the different groups. </p>\n                  <p>Once you have put together some hypotheses on your target segment, put your wireframe in front of them. Observe their behavior and note their questions. This will provide insights that will allow you to refine the product. Did a majority of users try to swipe on a screen? Did they touch a button and get a different flow than anticipated? Did one customer segment have a different use case than anticipated?</p>\n                  <p>Feedback can hurt and erode one’s ego. Get over it. Finish the slice of humble pie and iterate on the product so you can get closer to product market fit. I recommend using Invision to distribute the wireframes since they have a great interface for web and mobile to simulate to your users how your app works. </p>\n                  <p>There isn’t a hard number to follow, especially as a startup with limited resources but I would look for a sample size of at least 30 before moving on to development. At this number you’ll start seeing recurring trends and know where to go next. Once complete, it’s time to pull the trigger on developing the application. The market won’t stop, so you want to get a product in more people’s hands as soon as possible. </p>\n                  <h4>3/ Start Development</h4>\n                  <p>Depending on what kind of app you plan to develop, you’ll need developers with different skillsets. Start looking for developers that are full-stack. What this means is that they are able to complete both the front-end and back-end of your application. Don’t know the difference? Let’s take a step back and explain. </p>\n                  <p>The front-end of the application refers to anything that the user can see and interact with. Let’s use Facebook as an example. When you log into a Facebook, the first thing displayed to you is the new feed. To the left of the feed are your pages, explore buttons, and shortcuts to various other applications. On the right of the feed are your pages, and so on. Front-end developers are responsible for making sure these are displayed to the end-user. </p>\n                  <p>Back-end developers are responsible for providing the information that’s displayed. Every time you log onto Facebook, new content is displayed onto your news feed. You may have a new friend request or notification to work out. Back-end developers are responsible for creating the server and database to send that information to the front-end for your users to interact with. </p>\n                  <p>I observed a startup that had a significant productivity gap because their developers fell into either category. As you could imagine, communication became an issue as neither side understood the naming conventions needed to sync their work. Life happens, and if someone is unavailable to meet, the project meets delays. A team comprised entirely of full-stack developers will avoid these unnecessary delays. </p>\n                  <p>Additionally, if you’re looking to build a mobile application, look for someone that knows React-Native. React-Native is a new framework from Facebook that allows you to build an iOS and Android application simultaneously. If a developer knows React-Native, you can already assume that they are on the cutting-edge of their craft. If they’re also full-stack, they’re definitely people you want to work with. </p>\n                  <h4>4/ Testing</h4>\n                  <p>Once the product is finished, you’ll want to test it with your friends and family before releasing it to mass market. Too often, entrepreneurs make the mistake of releasing it to market without testing which leads to an overall poor market response. </p>\n                  <p>You will want to identify as many friends and family as possible beforehand that are willing to help you test out the application to identify any bugs in the application. When you identify a bug, you should always have that person try to replicate it. For example, if the app always crashes when they take a picture, have the user re-open the app and try to take a picture again. If it happens twice, note it for you development team.</p>\n                  <p>In these notes, include many details as possible. They may include:</p>\n                  <ul>\n                      <li>What were the users actions leading up to the crash?</li>\n                      <li>What device was the user on?</li>\n                      <li>The connection, was it on Wi-Fi or 4G?</li>\n                      <li>Screenshots if possible</li>\n                  </ul>\n                  <p>Supply ample details go a long way in allowing developers to quickly address the bugs.</p>\n                  <h4>5/ Shipping</h4>\n                  <p>Congratulations on reaching this milestone! Your app is on the app store and now you’re waiting to release it to the world. There are, however, still a few things to keep in mind.</p>\n                  <p>First, ensure that your acquisition plan is aligned with release date. Ship dates move, and bugs may delay your release plans. Adjust your acquisition plan as necessary so you can get the most ROI for your acquisition dollars. </p>\n                  <p>Second, know what acquisition channel has the best retention. As you onboard more cohorts (customer segments) take note of who those people are and what the best channel is to reach them. If your app is released and you find out gamers have the most activity, do you find them on Youtube or Twitch? Make sure you have analytics in place to measure this engagement.</p>\n                  <p>I hope these steps help you on your way to getting your app to market. Just remember, if the product doesn’t make sense, don’t put it out there. It hurts, but pouring water into a leaky bucket will leave you with an empty bucket. This should be mitigated by steps 1 and 2, but in case you still have that problem, fix the product first. If your users don’t get the app, identify why that is and create a plan to fix it before you continue. </p>\n                  <img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"/img/blog/0/closer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"auto\" />\n                  <p>Developing an app can sound complex and intimidating, but so is entrepreneurship.

What I wanted to create was a platform where users can see other users on a map and request a photo from them to have a real-time look at that location. It was a way for people to have an objective view of the world. </p>\n                  <p>It was a great concept, but poorly executed starting with the development of our minimum viable product (MVP). I brought a developer to the team that was a front-end iOS guy in September. Shortly after, a back-end developer from the University of Illinois-Urbana in November. A week later, the last piece came together; a designer. </p> \n                  <p>What I want to share is what happened, the mistakes I made, and how I would have done things differently. </p> \n                  <p>Once I had the team in place, development on the back-end started in mid-December. Our designer put together a few test screens for the initial look of the application before going dark on us for a few days. It’s a startup, it’s not for everyone and I get that. I came to find out he had some relationship woes that he needed to address before he could continue. I understood and communicated when we expected him back at work. </p> \n                  <p>Three weeks passed until he surfaced and as you can imagine our development cycle had a severe bottleneck. Unsurprisingly, he quit after I welcomed him back. The consummate hustler he claimed to be evaporated leaving us looking for another designer. We eventually released the product, but the development time it took to release could have been mitigated with a different approach saving us time and money. It cost us a total of $80k to bring our app to market. </p> \n                  <p>I should have started with the wireframes first. Starting here would have been most cost effective and would have given me more time to raise while also keeping our burn under control. As you can imagine, there was a point where our developers were collecting a check to wait. Sounds like some parts of the military where hurry up and wait is the perpetual norm, but in this case it had a direct correlation to our company’s bank account. I would have started there before committing to any development time. </p> \n                  <p>Once the wireframes were in some of our prospective user’s hands, I would have started the process of finding developers. You would have to hire for technical skillsets that your app needs, but I would have aimed for full-stack developers (knows both front-end and back-end development). By the time I identified who would join our team, I would have had feedback and an iteration completed on the wireframes. Just in time for a team to start the build out of the application.  </p> \n                  <p>It took me a total of 4 months to assemble a team that would have been the first hires of the company. Admittedly, I was relying on finding people that would come on board with a hope and a dream.  Not only was this limiting, but it took 4 months to assemble the team. That’s 4 months that I wasn’t on the market, and 4 months that I wasn’t doing customer development.</p> \n                  <p>If someone ever disrupted the time-travel industry, I would go back to 2014 and just hire a complete product team to handle the entire process. A competent team would have had a designer on-hand to design the wireframes and developers to create those wireframes. All led by a product manager that built camaraderie with the team allowing them to optimize their strengths to create the best possible product. I failed in that regard and left little time for the other important priority; traction. </p> \n                  <img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"/img/blog/1/closer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"auto\" .>\n                  <p>Using a product team to create an MVP would have halved the time to bring a product to market and given me greater ability to raise funding. <strong>Had we taken this approach, we would have gone further than we did.</strong></p>','2017-05-26 12:00:00','2017-05-26 12:00:00'),(3,'default','teaser.jpg','WHY STARTING WITH CULTURE MATTERS','<p>Equipped with what I read in books and prior experience from a handful of failed businesses, I \n                                    started my first tech venture in 2014.

I decided to go forward anyway.</p>\n                  <p>The first step was to build the team to create our app. I was in a mad rush to put one together. I went to meetups every night in the Bay Area, looking for developers and trying to gain a cursory understanding of the technologies we would need. It took me 4 months to find a CTO and 6 months to find our first iOS developer. </p> \n                  <p>We went through a lot during that time and it was a grind. We ran on fumes, going month to month keeping afloat. I was worrying about things like driving team members around, getting ahold of them to come to work, and even finding where to house them for the night. I felt like I spent more time putting out fires and worrying about petty problems than properly developing the app. Overall I’m at fault because this is the team I drafted. </p> \n                  <p>In the end, our startup failed. There were multiple reasons. Out of money, lack of skillsets, lack of product-market fit, loss of motivation, fundamental disagreements. These were typical startup problems, but they stemmed from my rush to piece everything together and ensuing disregard for fit.</p> \n                  <p>Time is a luxury that startups do not have. Looking back, I could have saved months and tens of thousands in the process by outsourcing the development of Limelight.  With this extra time I would have been able to focus on further defining our company culture, hiring to those values, and getting traction for our product.  </p> \n                  <p>Taking this lesson to heart, I saw the need in the market to take the pain out of building a MVP. I started Ronin Dev with the main goal of providing founders with a team that can create their minimum viable product the right way without all the difficulties that I experienced. </p> \n                  <img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"/img/blog/2/closer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"auto\" />\n                  <p>I’m happy to say that the members of Ronin Dev share the same values.

Start focusing on how much you can bear.”<p>\n                                    <p>Startups are hard, that’s why successful founders are a rare breed. Often, our egos lead us to taking on more work than we can handle which makes the ‘easy wrong’ as a tempting option. Have the humility to acknowledge what your cannot do and accept that you may need help.  Always pick the harder right. <p>\n                                    <img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"/img/blog/3/closer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"auto\" />\n                                    <h4>4.

You need a reason in life to do things, and for me I don’t know what else would drive me if it wasn’t by having someone else to do this for.”<p>\n                                    <p>Ask yourself why you’re doing this. What will keep you motivated through the difficulties that you will face on your journey to building a successful company. Staying constantly reminded of this will help you overcome the many challenges along the way and galvanize you to push through those tough times. <p>\n                                    <h4>5.
